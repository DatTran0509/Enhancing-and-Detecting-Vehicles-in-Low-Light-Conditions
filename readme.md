# 🚗 Detect Vehicles in Low-Light Conditions

In applications like surveillance, smart traffic systems, and autonomous vehicles, vehicle detection plays a crucial role. However, current systems often fail or degrade significantly under **low-light conditions** such as nighttime, tunnels, or bad weather.

This project — **"Detect Vehicles in Low-Light Conditions"** — aims to improve detection accuracy by combining **image enhancement (Zero-DCE)** with **object detection (YOLOv8 / Faster R-CNN)** for better visibility and safety in poor lighting environments.

### 🧠 Stage 1: Image Enhancement
- The input image is usually very dark or noisy.
- The system first **resizes the image to 640×640**, then performs **enhancement** via:
  - Histogram Equalization
  - Zero-DCE (Deep Curve Estimation)
- Optionally, **denoising** is applied to clean the enhanced image.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Stage 2: Vehicle Detection
- Once the image is enhanced, it is passed into one of the detection models:
  - **YOLOv8** (default)
  - or **Faster R-CNN** (optional)
- Detected vehicles include: `car`, `bike`, `bus`, `truck`, `boat`.

## 🖥️ Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed using **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**, enabling both human-friendly HTML upload and API-based interaction. Everything is packaged in Docker for fast deployment.

| Stage                | Component                   | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Enhancement**   | Zero-DCE, Histogram EQ      | Brightens under-exposed images                        |
| **2. Detection**     | YOLOv8 / Faster R-CNN       | Identifies vehicles in the enhanced image             |
| **3. Web Service**   | FastAPI + Uvicorn           | REST + HTML interface for image upload and inference  |
